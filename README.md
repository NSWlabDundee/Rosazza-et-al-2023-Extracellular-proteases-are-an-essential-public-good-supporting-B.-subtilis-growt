"parameters.m" contains the parameter values used in the simulations.

"odesys.m" is a function called by the ODE solver used to simulate the model.

"single_model_run.m" simulates the model once.

"single_strain_runs_one_plot.m" simulates single-strain cultures in each nutrient condition.

"co_culture_single_runs.m" simulates co-cultures in each nutrient condition

"co_cultures_EP_cost_change.m" simulates the model for varying EP production costs and calculates the relative cost.

"initial_ratio_vs_yield_combined.m" simulates the model for changing initial population ratios and calculates the total yield of growth.

"initial_ratio_vs_final_ratio.m" simulates the model for changing initial population ratios and calculates the final WT population.

"ExtracellularProteasesPublicGood.ipynb" regroup the JupyterNotebook code that have been used to analyse and visualise data presented in this paper.
